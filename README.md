# IN1010 Obliger

This repository was made by __Sigurd Pettersen__ and it holds all my solutions to the assignments given
by the University in Oslo for in the IN1010 course of 2022. If you wish to use this for helping with your own
assignment go ahed, but __PLEASE DO NOT DIRECTLY COPY__ because if you do and I get a call from the teachers,
all the code here will have to be moved to a private repository and your name will be the only thing left in
this README.md file. So take my advice, just use this to understand the assignment and make your own code work.
